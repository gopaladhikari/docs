# HTML: HyperText Markup Language

- HTML is the basic building block of any website. It defines the meaning and structure of a web content.

- The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.

```
# Note

- Hypertext refers to the links that connects web pages to one another, within single website or multiple websites.

- Markup refers to special elements such as <head>,<title>,<body>,<header>,<footer> and many more.
```

# CSS: Cascading Style Sheets

- CSS is the code that styles the web content. It is not a programming language.

- CSS is selectively used to style HTML elements. For example this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:

```css
p {
	color: red;
}
```

# JavaScript

- Javascript is a lightweight interpreted or JIT complied language
- It is a first class function
- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single thread language
- Invented by Brendan Eich

```
# Note

- A programming language is said to be first class function if the function in that language can be used as a value, that means it can be passed as a parameter or treated like a variable

- Prototype based is a style of OOP, where classes are not defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, adding them to an empty object dynamically.

- Multi paradigm is a style of writing code that offers a set of rules, principles, and practices for designing and implementing computer programs such as: Imperative programming, Delcarative programming, Functional programming, OOP programming, Procedure programming and Event driven programming

- Imperative programming focus on steps to acheive a specific goal. It changes the program state.

- Delcarative programming focus on expressing on the computation without describing its control flow. It doesn't focus on step-by-step process. Ideally it focus on designing the state rahter than manipulating the state but in some scenarios it can change the state

- Single thread language means only one task is executed at a time.
```

# TypeScript

- Typescript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to catch error within the editor.

- TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript code.

- Typescript understand JavaScript which proivdes type inference.
