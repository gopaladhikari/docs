/* 
*  ---------- Pseudo-classes ----------
*
*  Pseudo-classes are used to select elements based on the certain state of an element. Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. For example, :hover is a pseudo-class.
*
*  The most common pseudo-classes are:
*   01. :link
*   02. :visited
*   03. :hover
*   04. :active
*   05. :focus
*   06. :target
*   07. :lang
*   08. last-child
*   09. only-child
*   10. invalid

/* 
* ----------- Pseudo Elements ------------

* Pseudo-elements  act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements.

* Pseudo-elements start with a double colon ::. ::before is an example of a pseudo-element. 

* Some of the pseudo elements are
* 1. ::before
* 2. ::after
* 3. ::first-line

/* 
	* ---------------- Generating content with ::before and ::after -----------

	* There are a couple of special pseudo-elements, which are used along with the content property to insert content into your document using CSS.

	* You could use these to insert a string of text, such as in the live example below. Try changing the text value of the content property and see it change in the output. You could also change the ::before pseudo-element to ::after and see the text inserted at the end of the element instead of the beginning.
