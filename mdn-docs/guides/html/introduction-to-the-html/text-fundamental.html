		<h1>The Gopal Adhikari Story</h1>

		<p>By gopaladhikari</p>

		<h2>Chapter 1: The dark night</h2>

		<p>
			It was a dark night. Somewhere, an owl hooted. The rain lashed down on
			the…
		</p>

		<h2>Chapter 2: The eternal silence</h2>

		<p>
			Our protagonist could not so much as a whisper out of the shadowy figure…
		</p>

		<h3>The specter speaks</h3>

		<p>
			Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
			upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"
		</p>

		<h2>Why do we need structure?</h2>

		<p>We can make any element into a heading size using css</p>

		<p>
			To answer this question, let's take a look at
			<a href="text-fundamentals/text-start.html"> text-start.html</a>. They
			aren't marked in any way. This way text appear in a single big chunck.
		</p>

		<h2>Why do we need semantics?</h2>
		<p>
			Semantic value will be used in multiple ways, for example by search
			engines and screen readers
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, you could make any element look like a top level
			heading. Consider the following:
		</p>
		<span style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0; display: block">
			Is this a top level heading?
		</span>

		This is a &lt;span&gt; element. It has no semantics.

		<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
		<p>
			List are everywhere for example, shopping list,todo list, direction to
			house etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			There are three types of three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and
			description.
		</p>
		<h3 id="unordered">Unordered</h3>
		<p>
			Unordered lists are used to mark up lists of items for which the order of
			the items doesn't matter. Let's take a shopping list as an example:
		</p>
		<p>
			Unordered list starts with &lt;ul&gt; which warps around list items i.e
			&lt;li&gt.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>milk</li>
			<li>eggs</li>
			<li>bread</li>
			<li>hummus</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="ordered">Ordered</h3>
		<p>
			Ordered lists are lists in which the order of the items does matter. Let's
			take a set of directions as an example
		</p>
		<p>
			Ordered list starts with &lt;ul&gt; which warps around list items i.e
			&lt;li&gt.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Drive to the end of the road</li>
			<li>Turn right</li>
			<li>Go straight across the first two roundabouts</li>
			<li>Turn left at the third roundabout</li>
			<li>The school is on your right, 300 meters up the road</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Nesting list</h3>
		<p>
			Its okay to nest one list inside another.Let's take the second list from
			our recipe example:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
			<li>
				Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.
			</li>
			<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
			<li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
			<li>
				If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
			</li>
			<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Since the last two bullets are very closely related to the one before
			them,it might make sense to nest them inside their own unordered list and
			put that list inside the current fourth bullet. This would look like so:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely.</li>
			<li>
				Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely.
			</li>
			<li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
			<li>
				Process all the ingredients into a paste.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.
					</li>
					<li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<em
			>So we need semantic to give the actual meaning to the content.
			<a href="text-fundamentals/text-completed.html">Here</a> is semantic
			version of
			<a href="text-fundamentals/text-start.html"> text-started.html </a>
		</em>

		<h2>Emphasis and importance</h2>
		<p>
			We would want to mark certain words as important or something different.
			HTML provides the &lt;<em>em</em>&gt; and &lt;<strong>strong</strong>&gt;
			tags.
		</p>
		<h3>Emphasis</h3>
		<p>We use the &lt;<em>em</em>&gt; tag to mark up such instance .</p>
		<p>
			Browser will render this as <em>emphasis text</em> as an italic text but
			it shoudn't be used to get italic text. To get italic we can use &lt;i&gt;
			tag or by adding css.Exmaple of emphasis
		</p>
		<p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>

		<h3>Strong importance</h3>
		<p>
			To emphasize important word we can bold them using &lt;strong&gt; tag, for
			example
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</li>
			<li>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We can nest strong and emphasis inside one another if desired:</p>
		<p>
			This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> — if you drink it,
			<strong>you may <em>die</em></strong
			>.
		</p>
