			<h1>Debugging the HTML</h1>

			<p>
				When something goes wrong, we can't find where the error is because HTML
				doesn't have errors.
			</p>

			<hr />
			<h2>HTML and debugging</h2>
			<p>
				HTML is not compiled into different form before the browser parse it. It
				is interpreted not compiled. HTML code is a lot more
				<strong>permissive</strong> than how a programming language is run.
			</p>

			<h3>Permissive code</h3>
			<p>
				When there is error is code, there are generally two type of error, i. e
				syntax error and logical error.
			</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>Syntax error</strong></dt>
				<dd>These are usually spelling mistake in the code.</dd>
				<br />
				<dt><strong>Logical error</strong></dt>
				<dd>
					These are error when the syntax is actually correct but the code
					doesn't behave as expected, meaninig the code runs incorrectly. These
					error ususally hard to detect because their is no any error message to
					direct to error cause.
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>
				HTML doesn't occur the syntax error because browser have built-in rules
				to state how to interpret the incorrectly written markup code, so there
				will be something running, even if it is not expected. This can still be
				a problem. HTML is parsed permissively because when the web was first
				created, it was decided that allowing people to get their content
				published was more important than the syntax was absolutely correct.
			</p>

			<h3>Active learning: Studying permissive code</h3>
			<p>Now let's see how to study permissive nature of code.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					In
					<a href="debugging-the-html/debug-demo.html" target="_blank">
						debug-demo.html</a
					>
					the written code is badly formatted. They are some built-in errors in
					the html code.
				</li>

				<li>Open above link the browser</li>
				<li>
					This doesn't look greate because the source code is not well
					formatted.
				</li>
				<li>
					Code errors
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element and
							<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element doesn't have proper closing tag.
						</li>
						<li>
							The first <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element has no closing tag
						</li>
						<li>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element is badly nested.</li>
						<li>
							The <code>href</code> attribute of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element
							has not closing double quote. Some weird name is displaying
							instead of the right name.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					The browser has tried to fixed fix our HTML error. Checking the code
					using DOM inspectator we get
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has the
							closing tag.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <code> &lt;strong&gt; </code> element has the closing tag.
						</li>
						<li>
							The incorrectly nesting of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element
							has been fixed.
						</li>
						<li>
							The <code>href</code> attribute of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element
							has not yet being fixed. Closing double quote is still missing.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				<strong>NOTE: </strong> well formatted code for
				<a href="debugging-the-html/debug-demo.html">debug-demo.html</a> can be
				found <a href="debugging-the-html/debug-demo-fixed.html">here.</a>
			</p>

			<h3>HTML validation</h3>
			<p>
				So we need really well formatted html. So the best strategy to check the
				error in HTML is running code in
				<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML validator</a>,
				we can provide the web address, html file or directly code.
			</p>

			<h3>Interpreting the error message</h3>
			<p>
				Error messages are ususally helpfull. Lets break download the error of
				<a href="debugging-the-html/debug-demo.html">debug-demo.html</a> in
				<a href="debugging-the-html/debug-demo.html">debug-demo.html</a>, we get
				the following errors.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong
						>End tag li implied, but there were open elements (2
						instances):</strong
					>
					this message indicated the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is opened
					and not closed. It should be closed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unclosed element <code> &lt;strong&gt;</code></strong>
					this message indicated the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element is
					opened and not closed. It should be closed.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>
						End tag <code> &lt;strong&gt;</code> violates nesting rules.
					</strong>
					this points out the incorrectly nested element.
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>
						End of file reached when inside an attribute value. Ignoring tag.
					</strong>
					this indicated that there is attribute value is upto the end of file
					because it is not closed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>End of file seen and there were open elements. </strong>
					this indicated that there are opened element that should be properly
					closed. An attribute missing a closing quote can result in an open
					element because the rest of the document is interpreted as the
					attribute's content.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Unclosed element <code> &lt;ul&gt;</code>. </strong>
					this indicated that there is an unclosed <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> but
					this is not helpful because there is closing tag. This is because the
					missing double quote in <code>href</code> attribute of
					<code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Sometimes fixing an earlier error will also get rid of other error
				messages â€” several errors can often be caused by a single problem, in a
				domino effect.
