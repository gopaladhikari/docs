		<h1>Document and website structure</h1>
		<p>
			We should define the individual part of the page using we need to plan a
			basic website structure and the write html to represent the structure.
		</p>

		<hr />
		<h2>Basic sections of a document</h2>
		<p>
			Webpages intended to shared standard structure unless the page is
			displaying some art such as audio, video or games.
		</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>header:</dt>
			<dd>
				Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps
				a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
			</dd>

			<dt>navigation bar:</dt>
			<dd>
				Links to the pages within the same website are usually represented by
				menu, link, button or tabs. So it is very important part of the website,
				having inconsistent navigation bar will lead to confusion and
				frustration to user. Many web designer consider navigation bar as the
				part of the header but it is not required.
			</dd>

			<dt>main content:</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the main area of the webpage that contains the most of the
				contents, for example video, or the main story , or the map, news
				headline etc.
			</dd>

			<dt>sidebar:</dt>
			<dd>
				In some the webpages sidebar may contain secondary navigation bar. In
				some the news article where the main content is in main content, author
				bio can be in sidebar.
			</dd>

			<dt>footer:</dt>
			<dd>
				It is generally located in the buttom of the webpage and contains
				copyright notices, contact info, which is generally not critical. The
				footer is also important for the seo propose.
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<hr />
		<h2>HTML for structuring content</h2>
		<p>
			Visual don't tell the whole story. We need to respect semantics and
			<strong>use the right element for the right job. </strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you
			can use to represent such sections, for example:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>header <code>&lt;header&gt;</code></li>
			<li>navigation <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></li>
			<li>footer <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
			<li>sidebar <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code></li>
			<li>main <code>&lt;main&gt;</code></li>
		</ul>
		<hr />
		<h2>HTML layout elements in more detail</h2>
		<p>Main defination of some of the html tags are</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>&lt;header&gt;</code> contains the introductory content. If it is
				used in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> it's a global header, if it is
				used in <code> &lt;article&gt; </code> or
				<code> &lt;section&gt; </code> it defines a specific header for that
				section.
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> contains the group of end content for a
				page. Usually it contain copyright notice and contact info.
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;main&gt;</code> contain the unique content for each page. It
				should be direct child of <code>&lt;body&gt; element </code>
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;article&gt;</code> is used for the related content still that
				make in it's own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog
				post).
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> is used for grouping together different
				part of page to form a signle page. <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> can be
				breaked into different <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and
				<code>&lt;article&gt;</code> can be breaked into different
				<code>&lt;section&gt;</code> depending on the content.
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> is not directly related to main content but
				can provide extra information indrectly.
			</li>

			<li>
				<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> contains the main navigation functionality for
				the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Non-semantic wrappers</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes we just need a wrappers that don't have semantic meaning, just
			for css or javascript to use. For this we have the
			<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element
		</p>

		<p>
			<code>&lt;span&gt;</code> is inline non-semantic element which should only
			be used if we don't want to add any semantic meaning to the content. For
			example
		</p>
		<p>
			The King walked drunkenly back to his room at 01:00, the beer doing
			nothing to aid him as he staggered through the door.
			<span class="editor-note">
				[Editor's note: At this point in the play, the lights should be down
				low].
			</span>
		</p>

		<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is block non-semantic element which should only be
		used if we don't want to add any semantic meaning to the content.For example
		<div class="shopping-cart">
			<header>
				<h3>Shopping cart</h3>
			</header>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<a href=""><strong>Silver earrings</strong></a
						>: $99.95.
					</p>
					<img src="../products/3333-0985/thumb.png" alt="Silver earrings" />
				</li>
				<li>â€¦</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Total cost: $237.89</p>
		</div>

		<hr />
		<h2>Line breaks and horizontal rules</h2>
		<p>
			We can use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> to add
			break or horizontal line.
		</p>

		<h3><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> the line break element</h3>
		<p>
			It creates a line break in a paragraph. In can be used in peom, address
			etc. For example
		</p>
		<p>
			There once was a man named O'Dell<br />
			Who loved to write HTML<br />
			But his structure was bad, his semantics were sad<br />
			and his markup didn't read very well.
		</p>
		<h3><code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> the thematic break element</h3>
		<p>
			It created horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change
			in the text (such as change in scene or topic ). Visually it looks like a
			horizontal line. For example
		</p>
		<p>
			Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
			determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
			battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.
		</p>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
			pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
			distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
			hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
		</p>

		<h2>Planning a simple website</h2>
		<p>
			We should plan the structure of the website, what content should put on,
			what pages are needed etc.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				To figure out the common elements in most of the pages such as header,
				footer etc.
			</li>
			<li>Draw the rough sketch of sructure of the website.</li>
			<li>Think about all other non common content of the website.</li>
			<li>
				Sort all these non common into groups, this gives idea what might be
				similar in different pages.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now try to sketch a rough sitemap to show the web flow of the website
				including notes about appearance if required. The homepage will probably
				be in the center, and link to most if not all of the others; most of the
				pages in a small site should be available from the main navigation,
				although there are exceptions.
			</li>
		</ol>
