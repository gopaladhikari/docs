				<h1>Images in HTML</h1>
				<p>
					Web without images are really boring. Here we are going to learn how
					to use images in HTML
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>How do we put an image on a webpage?</h2>
				<p>
					To put image in web page we use &lt;img&gt; tag. The &lt;img&gt; tag
					is a void element, which means it doesn't have any children and end
					tag. We use src attribute to specify the source of the image.
				</p>
				<img src="images/dinosaur.png" alt="alt text" />

				<p>
					Search engines also counts filename towards SEO. Therefore we should
					give proper filename to the image, <code>html.jpg</code> is better
					name than <code>img123.jpg</code>
				</p>

				<p>
					You could also embed the image using its absolute URL, for example:
				</p>

				<img
					src="images/dinosaur.png"
					alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton; it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
					width="400"
					height="341"
					title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum"
				/>

				<p>
					Linking through absolute url is not recommended because when changing
					the domain, we need to update each image link.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pointing the src attribute to an image in someone else hosted website
					is hotlinking. It is considered a unehtical because someone else is
					paying for bandwidth.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h2>Alternative text</h2>
				<p>
					It is the textual description of the image. If the image is not able
					to load.
				</p>
				<img
					src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
					alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
				/>

				<p>The reason we need a alt text are</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It is used to describe the screen reader.</li>
					<li>Spelling of the filename or path can be wrong.</li>
					<li>
						Some people still use the text only browser such as lynx which
						doesn't support images.
					</li>
					<li>
						It helps for SEO, for example search engines can match alt text with
						search queries.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<hr />
				<h2>Width and height</h2>
				<p>
					We can also specify the width and height of the image using the
					<code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes. They are
					integer wihout unit and are represented in pixels.
				</p>
				<img
					src="images/dinosaur.png"
					alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
					width="400"
					height="341"
				/>

				<p>
					As soon as the image loads, it will be displayed in the browser. But
					sometimes the HTML is received but images will take time to load. But
					when the images are loaded the image is displayed in this case browser
					has to move the text dowm which is very distracting to the user if
					they started to read the content. So providing the height and width is
					very important. Browser knows how much space should be left to fit the
					image and when recieved the image it displayed it, without moving the
					text down.
				</p>

				<hr />
				<h2>Image titles</h2>
				<p>
					As link we can also add titles to the image to support screen reader
					and providing futher information the user.
				</p>
				<img
					src="images/dinosaur.png"
					alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
          it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
					width="400"
					height="341"
					title="A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum"
				/>

				<img
					src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/master/html/multimedia-and-embedding/images-in-html/dinosaur_small.jpg"
					alt="dinosaur in the Museum"
					width="200"
					height="171"
				/>

				<hr />
				<h2>Media assets and licensing</h2>
				<p>
					Images and other assets comes with different licenses. We can't just
					use the random image found over the internet. Let's understand the
					<strong>licensing types</strong>
				</p>
				<h3>All rights reserved</h3>
				<p>
					Sometimes creater of the original work such as songs, books or image
					release their work under closest copyright licenses. It means only the
					creator or pubisher have the right to use or distribute it. We need
					any one of following permission to use it.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Written permission by the creator or publisher.</li>
					<li>Pay the license fee.</li>
					<li>
						Limit the use of those work may be considered as
						<a
							href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/"
							target="_blank"
						>
							<strong>fair use</strong>
						</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Author are not required to include copyright license term with their
					work. Copyright automatically exist in original work once it is in
					tangible medium. So if there is an image in the internet the safest
					assumption is to consider it under
					<strong>all rights reserved</strong>.
				</p>

				<h3>Permissive</h3>
				<p>
					Some images are released under permissive license such as
					<a href="https://mit-license.org/"><strong>MIT</strong></a
					>,
					<a href="https://opensource.org/license/BSD-3-clause"
						><strong>BSD</strong></a
					>
					or
					<a href="https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/"
						><strong>Creative Commons (CC) license</strong></a
					>, where we do not need a pay or seek the permission to use it, still
					there are some licensing to fulfill such as
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Provide a link to the original source of the image and credit its
						creator.
					</li>
					<li>Indicate whether any changes were made to it.</li>
					<li>Not use the image in any commercial work.</li>
					<li>
						Include a copy of the license along with any release that uses the
						image.
					</li>
					<li>
						Share any derivative works created using the image under the same
						license as the original.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Sometimes we may hear about <strong>copyleft</strong> in permissive
					licenses. Copyleft licenses such as
					<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">
						<strong>GNU General Public License (GPL)</strong>
					</a>
					demands that derivates need to be released under same licenses as
					original.
				</p>

				<p>
					New project built with the code of a
					<strong>copyleft-licensed</strong> which is also know as "fork", will
					need under the license of same licensed.
				</p>

				<h3>Public domain/CC0</h3>
				<p>
					Work under the public domain are often refer as "no right reserved",
					no copyright applies to it and can be used without permission.
				</p>

				<hr />
				<h2>Annotating images with figures and figure captions</h2>

				<p>Their are number of ways to add caption to the image, for example</p>
				<div class="figure">
					<img
						src="images/dinosaur.png"
						alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
										it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
						width="400"
						height="341"
					/>

					<p>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</p>
				</div>
				<p>
					This is okay but styled ina good way but it doesn't semantically links
					the image to the capiton. So we can use html <code> figure </code> and
					<code> figcaption </code> elements. Which was created to provide
					semantic container for figures, and clearly links figure to caption.
					for example
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img
						src="images/dinosaur.png"
						alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
										it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
						width="400"
						height="341"
					/>

					<figcaption>
						A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>
					A figure could be several images, a code snippet, audio, video,
					equations, a table, or something else.
